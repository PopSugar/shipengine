## About
A PHP wrapper for the accessing and interacting with the ShipEngine v1 API.

## How to use
```php
$shipEngine = new jsamhall\ShipEngine('your_shipengine_api_key');
$carriers = $shipEngine->listCarriers();
```

## Addresses
ShipEngine expects a certain address format. This Library offers the `Address\AddressDto` class which conforms
to this format. All API endpoints that require an Address (e.g., validation, rating, labels etc.) expect an
`Address\AddressDto` in order to ensure consistency and compatibility.

You should write an implementation `Address\FormatterInterface` that extracts data from your domain-specific
Address in the format expected by the ShipEngine API. This implementation is a constructor argument for the
`Address\Factory` class which will translate your Domain's Address Model to an instance of `Address\AddressDto`
